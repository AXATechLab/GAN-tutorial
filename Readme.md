Notes:
 - Make sure the notebook is saved: Press _Copy to Drive_ button if you see the Playground indicator next to the title (a cut floppy disk)
 - Connect to a GPU runtime: Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator -- Select GPU
   - While you're here, note that we will show quite a few images in the notebooks, which will significantly increase their size, making them slow to load in the future. 
   You can choose to not save these along with the notebook by ticking the checkbox _Omit code cell output when saving this notebook_
 - When running the cell, you will be prompted if you trust our notebook. Do you? :)
